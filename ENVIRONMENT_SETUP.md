# Environment Variables Setup

## Required Environment Variables

You need to set these environment variables in your Vercel dashboard:

### 1. OpenAI API Key
- **Variable Name**: `OPENAI_API_KEY`
- **Value**: Your OpenAI API key (starts with `sk-`)
- **Required**: Yes

## How to Set Environment Variables in Vercel

1. Go to your Vercel dashboard
2. Select your project
3. Go to Settings â†’ Environment Variables
4. Add the variables listed above
5. Make sure to set them for Production, Preview, and Development environments

## Local Development

For local development, create a `.env.local` file in your project root:

```env
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
```

## API Endpoints

After deployment, your API will be available at:
- Production: `https://your-app-name.vercel.app/api`
- Local: `http://localhost:3000/api`

Make sure to update your frontend code to use the production API URL when deployed.
