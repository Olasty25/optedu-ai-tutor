# üîç DEBUG CHECKLIST - Let's Find the Real Problem!

## Step 1: Check Vercel Function Logs
1. Go to [vercel.com/dashboard](https://vercel.com/dashboard)
2. Your project ‚Üí Functions tab
3. Click on any function (like `/api/health`)
4. Look at the logs - what error do you see?

## Step 2: Check Environment Variables
1. Go to Settings ‚Üí Environment Variables
2. Do you see `OPENAI_API_KEY` in the list?
3. Click on it - does the value start with `sk-`?
4. Is it enabled for "Production"?

## Step 3: Check Deployment Status
1. Go to Deployments tab
2. Is the latest deployment successful (green checkmark)?
3. Or is it failed (red X)?

## Step 4: Check Function Count
1. Go to Functions tab
2. How many functions do you see listed?
3. Should be 9 functions total

## Step 5: Test Different Endpoints
Try these URLs one by one:
- `https://your-app.vercel.app/api/health`
- `https://your-app.vercel.app/api/chat`
- `https://your-app.vercel.app/` (main app)

## Step 6: Check Vercel Plan
1. Go to Settings ‚Üí General
2. What plan are you on? (Hobby, Pro, Team)
3. If Hobby, you might have hit limits

## Common Issues:
- ‚ùå Environment variable not set correctly
- ‚ùå Deployment failed but you didn't notice
- ‚ùå Hit Vercel limits (functions, bandwidth, etc.)
- ‚ùå Wrong Vercel project selected
- ‚ùå Code not actually deployed

## Tell Me:
1. What do you see in the Vercel function logs?
2. What's the status of your latest deployment?
3. How many functions do you see in the Functions tab?
4. What happens when you visit the health URL?

**The problem is NOT in the code - it's in the Vercel setup!**
